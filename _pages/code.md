A collection of my more useful/interesting Github repositories.
A complete collection of my work can be found on [Github](https://github.com/ColinKohler).

## BulletArm
**BulletArm** is a [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) based benchmark and learning-environment for robotic manipulation research.
The development of this package was part of the work done in our [ISRR 22 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14292).

The goal of this package is two fold: (1) to provide a wrapper around the PyBullet simulator to enable rapid development of robotic 
manipulation environments for use in robotic learning and (2) present a comprehensive benchmark for use in either open-loop or closed-loop
control. This benchmark currently consists of 19 different manipulation tasks of varying difficulty. Additional information about this 
package can be found in either the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14292.pdf) or [documentation](https://colinkohler.github.io/BulletArm/).

## Torch Utils
Collection of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) modules/utils packaged for ease of use. Primarily used for rapid prototyping of new projects.
Added to iteratively as I find new and interesting PyTorch tips and tricks.

## Harry Potter Dungeon Crawl Clone 
Dungeon crawler set in the Harry Potter universe. Heavily inspired by Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. Very much so a work in progress at this point.
